2. A range HTML element has been used to select the password length. The range has a min value equal to 8 and max value equal to 128.
3. The checkbox HTML elements have been used to select the different password criteria.
4. An event listener has been added when a user clicks on the ***Get a password*** button.
5. An event listener has been added when a user clicks on the ***Copy to clipboard*** button.


### Functional Specification:
1. A Modal popup will be displayed when a user clicks on the ***Generate Password*** button.
2. A user can select password length using a range slider.
3. A user has been presented with a series of password criteria.
4. An alert will be displayed when a user clicks on the ***Get a password*** button without selecting any criteria.
5. Once a user clicks on the ***Get a password*** button then the password will be generated as per selected criteria
6. Once a user clicks on the ***Copy to clipboard*** button then the password will be copied and the modal popup will be closed.
